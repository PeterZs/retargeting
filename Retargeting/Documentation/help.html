            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p class="justify">The application consists of two main parts. In the <a href="#library">library</a>, you can store and preview all the images that you retargeted so far. In the <a href="#editor">editor</a>, you can refine and reformat a single image to a new aspect ratio.</p>
            
            <h3 id="library">Library</h3>
            <p><center><img class="fullimg" src="gallery.jpg"></center></p>
            <p class="justify">To add images to the library, use the two buttons on the top left. You can either take a picture with the built-in camera or choose an image from your camera roll.<br>
                In order to edit a picture, add it to the gallery and then tap on it. To remove a picture from the gallery, tap and hold on the picture and confirm that you want to delete it.<br>
                By pinching with two fingers, you can change the size of the thumbnails in the gallery. After the import, the thumbnail will just show the original image. Once you have edited an image the app automatically saves an optimized square thumbnail to use every pixel of your screen.
            </p>
            <h3 id="editor">Editor</h3>
            <p><center><img class="fullimg" src="editor.jpg"></center></p>
            <p class="jusitfy">This is the place where you can change the aspect ratio of an image and paint the important parts of the image. 
            You can start by simply painting into the image with a single finger. You will see that the marked regions will get highlighted in white. To change the aspect ratio, you can use two fingers and swipe up and down to retarget the image. You can also choose one of the predefined aspect ratios by tapping on the little icon with the coordinate axis: <img src="ratio@2x.png" height=15px></p>
            <p class="justify">The following list explains the buttons in the toolbar on the top. On iPhones and iPods, the full list of buttons is only visible in landscape mode.</p>
            
                <h4>Toolbar Buttons</h4>
                from left to right:
                <ul>
                <li>
                    <p class="justify">
                        <b>Close</b><br>
                        This button saves your work and brings you back to the gallery.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="justify">
                        <img src="settings@2x.png" width="15px"> <b>Settings</b><br>
                        Here you can define whether the deformation is allowed to crop parts of the images and you can choose the size of the paint brush. The advanced settings give you access to the detailed parameters of the retargeting algorithm.  For instance, you can show the underlying quad grid or enable regularization. Some of the exposed parameters are only for demo purposes to show the inner workings of the underlying algorithm. All of them are preset to values that are working well in most cases. So you should only change them if you want to explore the details of the retargeting algorithm.
                    </p>
                </li>

                        <b>Export</b><br>
                        A tap on this button renders a full resolution retargeted image in the current aspect ratio and saves it to the camera roll, so that you can insert it to emails, blogs, and so on.

                        By clicking the wand button, the app tries to automatically detect salient image parts. The app looks for strong edges and borders and detects faces in the image.
